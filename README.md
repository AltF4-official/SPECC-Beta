SPECC is an early-stage demo of a browser-based 2D space shooter game. The goal of the project is to create an arcade-style experience featuring:

Wave-based enemy combat

A variety of ranged and melee weapons

A microchip-based currency system

A customizable settings menu

Save/load functionality

At this point in development, the game includes a fully animated title screen and an interactive in-game shop where players can browse and purchase items. Core gameplay systems — such as movement, shooting mechanics, and enemy wave generation — are currently in progress.

This demo highlights the visual design direction, UI mechanics, and the foundational systems that will support future gameplay features. It’s built entirely with vanilla JavaScript and designed to run directly in the browser.
